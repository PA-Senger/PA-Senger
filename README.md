👋 Hello, I'm Pierre-Antoine, an applied mathematics student at the University of Strasbourg.

📚 I have a passion for understanding the intricacies of the universe and everything in it. The world of sciences, from the microscopic to the cosmic, fascinates me.

🐱 Apart from my academic pursuits, I find joy in the company of cats—they're just purrfect! 🐾

⛰️ Climbing and skiing are not just physical activities for me; they are adventures that push my limits and connect me with nature.

📖 When I'm not solving mathematical problems, you'll find me immersed in the captivating realms of science fiction literature. It's my escape to fantastical worlds and imaginative storytelling.

🌌 Join me on this journey of curiosity and exploration as I navigate the fascinating landscapes of applied mathematics and beyond!
